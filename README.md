# array-push-at-sort-position

Push items to an array at their correct sort-position which is much faster then re-sorting the array.

Adding an item to an array with `push()` and `sort()` has `O(n*log(n))`
while inserting the item at the correct sort-position has `O(n)`.

```bash
  npm install array-push-at-sort-position --save
```

```typescript

// instead of pushing and resorting like this:
const arrayWithNewItems = arrayWithItems.slice();
arrayWithNewItems.push(newItem);
arrayWithNewItems = arrayWithNewItems.sort(sortComparator);

// you can push the newItem directly into the correct sorting position
const arrayWithNewItems = pushAtSortPosition(
  arrayWithItems,
  newItem,
  sortComparator
);
```
